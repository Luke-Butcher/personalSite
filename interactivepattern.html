    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>This is an interactive Python pattern displaying program, created as my first programming project at university.</p>
    <h3>The task</h3>
      <p>The task for this project was to  generate a predefined pattern based on the scale and colours defined by the user
         as a demonstartion of skill for my introduction to programing unit in my fisrt year of university.
       </article>
         <article>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>The program should begin by prompting the user using a text-based interface to enter the patchwork size the desired three colours
        <li>The program must ensure are all the colours are different.</li>
        <li>The programâ€™s user interface should be easy to use, friendly and robust.</li>
        <li>On entering invalid data, the user should be re-prompted until the entered data is valid</li>
        <li>A patchwork sample is made up of patches of two different designs and three colours. </li>
        <li>Patchworks are square and can be of three different sizes: 5 x 5, 7 x 7 and 9 x 9.</li>
        <li>The program must draw the patches using the facilities provided in the graphics module (Line, Circle etc.),</li>
        <li>The program must not use bitmapped images</li>

      </ul>
    <h3>Stretch goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>After the patchwork design has been drawn, the program must allow the user to change the colour of patches by clicking on them with the mouse.</li>
          <li>The colours must cycle in the order they were entered by the user</li>
          <li>The user must be able to make as many colour changes to as many patches as they wish</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Results</h3>

      <p>Each goal was met including the stretch goals resulting in an overall grade of 98% for this project upon presentation.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p> This project was very enjoyable, in particular I enjoyed going back over the project once
         I had a working framework and finding ways to improve the robustness of the user
         interface</p>
