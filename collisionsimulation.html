    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>This project was designed to develop object-oriented programming skills, including designing, documenting, testing and debugging of Java code as part of the introduction to programming unit.</p>
    <h3>The task</h3>
      <p>The simulation would model a pinball machine and the collisions of different objects with unique effects and end once a ball passes through the gap at the bottom of the machine.
      </article>
      <article>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>Create walls, objects that are black in colour that are impassable to all other objects </li>
        <li>Create ball type one, features, change direction when colliding with a wall, change speed when colliding with another ball.</li>
        <li>Create the bumpers, Bumpers are static circular objects within the machine, which will always be grey in colour</li>
        <li>Create the exit gap to end the simulation</li>
        <li>Create ball type two, feature change colour when colliding with the edge, change size when colliding with a ball.</li>
        <li>Create hole object, feature, balls will be removed if the fit inside the hole, glide over it if the do not.</li>
        <li>Implement scoring system
          <ul>
            <li>Colliding with a wall - 1 point</li>
            <li>Colliding with a bumper - 2 points</li>
            <li>Colliding with another pinball - 5 points</li>
            <li>Coming into contact with a hole - lose all points collected by that pinball</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Code quality based on: its overall structure (ensuring that the principles of object-oriented programming have been incorporated), its readability and structure, and the quality of the algorithms used.</li>

      </ul>
    <h3>Stretch goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Display high score table at the end of the simulation</li>
          <li>Documentation</li>

        </ul>
    <h3>Results</h3>

      <p>Each goal was met including the stretch goals resulting in an overall grade of 100% for this project upon presentation.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p> Collision detection was a lot of fun in particular I enjoyed working with a brief and being set lose to make the solution as however I saw best this was the first assessed project I had worked on with such a set up and it was immensely interesting researching the many different ways to approach the core problems. I found the layout of BlueJ to be very useful for showing class inheritance and dependencies it was quite satisfying reducing the dependencies and ensuring the inheritance was a simple logical flow of increasingly complex classes and having that graphical display showing the results. </p>
